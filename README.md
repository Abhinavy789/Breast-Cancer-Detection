# Breast Cancer Detection

### OBJECTIVE:
The repository is a learning excercise to:

- Apply the basic machine learning concept to an existing dataset.
- Train the model and obtain accuracy of the model.
- Creating a notebook and writing all computational records in it.

The analysis is divided into following sections:

- Importing the libraries and dataset
- Modifying table and content by taking care of missing data
- Finding number of malignant and benign cells 
- Splitting the dataset into training and test set 
- Training the model on the training set
- Predicting the accuracy of different models
